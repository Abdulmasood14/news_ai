Complete_Text,"Fixed Deposit (FD) Interest Rates:PNB revised its retail FD interest rates (below ₹3 crore), cutting rates by up to 25 basis points (bps) on select short- and medium-term tenures. The revised rates are effective from May 1, 2025.

ATM Charges:PNB notified customers about changes in ATM transaction charges, following the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) revised framework effective May 1, 2025. Customer charges for transactions exceeding the free limit at other bank ATMs were revised to ₹23 per financial transaction and ₹11 per non-financial transaction (excluding GST), effective from May 9, 2025.

Share Performance:PNB's share price closed in the red on May 1, 2025, according to a JM Financial note, though another source states it fell -0.40% on May 5, 2025.

Investor Guidance:Brokerage firm Motilal Oswal maintained a ""Buy"" rating on PNB with a target price of ₹125, indicating a potential upside of approximately 32%. The brokerage firm highlighted healthy loan growth, but noted that net interest income was below estimates due to margin compression, and slippages had risen. They expect margins to remain under pressure in the first half of FY26, but to improve in the second half.

Subsidiary Policy:The Board of PNB reviewed its ""Policy on Determination of Material Subsidiaries"" on February 28, 2025, to ensure compliance with SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015. This policy was updated in March 2024.

Financial Results:PNB announced that the financial results for the quarter and year ended March 31, 2025, would be declared on May 7, 2025. The bank registered a net profit of ₹16,630 crore during FY25, a year-on-year growth of 101.7%. Net profit for Q4FY25 was ₹4,567 crore.

Financial Inclusion:PNB waived penalty charges for non-maintenance of minimum average balance (MAB) in all savings accounts, effective July 1, 2025. This measure aims to promote financial inclusion, particularly benefiting women, farmers, and low-income households.

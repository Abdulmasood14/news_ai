Based on the information available as of May 1, 2025, here's a summary of the latest news and updates related to Polycab India:

Polycab India was scheduled to announce its Q4 and full FY25 financial results during the week of May 5, 2025. The board of directors planned to meet on May 6, 2025, to approve the financial statements and consider a dividend for FY2024-25. The trading window for Polycab securities was closed from April 1, 2025, until May 8, 2025.

Analysts anticipated strong performance in Q4FY25, citing factors such as the execution of the RDSS order book, momentum in the wires and cables segment, and improving FMEG business. One brokerage maintained a ""Buy"" rating with a target price of ₹7,152.

According to a report, Polycab aims for ₹20,000 crore in revenues by FY26. The company is expected to benefit from government initiatives and increased housing demand. Polycab also intends to increase export contribution to 10%.

As of August 21, 2025, Polycab's share price had seen fluctuations, including a decline in the six months prior to May 1, 2025, but with some recent recovery. The stock gained over 13% in the month before May 5, 2025, but fell 15.46% in the preceding six months and nearly 24% year-to-date. Following strong Q4 FY25 results on May 6, 2025, the share price rose 4.8% on the BSE.

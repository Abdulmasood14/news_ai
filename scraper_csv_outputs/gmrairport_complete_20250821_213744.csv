Complete_Text,"Aviation Sector Growth:In May 2025, the Indian aviation sector continued its strong growth trajectory. Domestic air passenger traffic for FY25 reached 165.4 million, a 7.6% year-on-year increase and 16.8% higher than pre-COVID levels (FY20). International passenger traffic handled by Indian carriers totaled 33.8 million in FY25, a 14.1% year-on-year growth and a 49% increase over pre-COVID levels. This overall growth likely positively impacted GMR Airports' performance.

New Airline Launches:Around May 2025 (and later in mid-2025), three new airlines – Shankh Air, Air Kerala, and Alhind Air – were preparing to launch operations. This expansion in the airline industry could have increased demand for airport services, benefiting GMR Airports.

GMR Airports Traffic Performance:GMR Airports reported handling over 10 million passengers in May 2025, a 0.8% year-on-year increase. While domestic traffic saw marginal growth (0.1%), international traffic grew by 2.9%, driving the overall increase. This indicates GMR Airports was capitalizing on the growth in international travel.

Individual Airport Performance (May 2025):Delhi Airport handled approximately 6.24 million passengers (a 4.5% year-on-year decrease), while Hyderabad Airport handled around 2.79 million passengers (a 15.3% year-on-year increase). This highlights varied performance across GMR's airport network.

Q1 FY26 Results:In their Q1 FY26 results (announced later), GMR Airports reported a 29.2% quarter-on-quarter and 31.7% year-on-year increase in consolidated revenues. However, the net profit decreased by 18.2% quarter-on-quarter and 59.4% year-on-year. These results provide insight into GMR Airports' financial performance in the period following May 2025.

GMR Airports Board Approvals (August 21, 2025):On August 21, 2025, GMR Airports' board approved raising up to ₹5,000 crore through securities issuance and setting up a wholly-owned subsidiary for a cargo city project at Delhi Airport. This demonstrates strategic initiatives for future growth and expansion.

GMR Airports Ltd's share price saw a slight decrease of -2.15% on August 21, 2025, closing at 89.05. There were no significant company-specific announcements on May 1, 2025. However, analyzing key events and news around that period provides relevant context.

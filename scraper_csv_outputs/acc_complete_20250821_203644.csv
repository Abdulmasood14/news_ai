Complete_Text,"ACC Cement, as part of the Adani Group's cement business, had already crossed the 100 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity milestone in April 2025. This aligns with the company's ambitious target of reaching 140 MTPA by the fiscal year 2027-28.

ACC's financial year likely starts in April. While the full Q1 FY26 results were released later in July, it's important to note the financial context of the period. For the financial year ended March 31, 2025, ACC Mineral Resources Limited (AMRL) completed the acquisition of fifteen companies for ₹298.61 crore. They also provided funds through inter-corporate deposits of ₹380.57 crore to these companies. This indicates a strategic drive towards consolidation and expansion leading into May 2025.

ACC, under the Adani Group, had become India's second-largest cement manufacturer in 2022 with a capacity of approximately 70 MTPA after acquiring Holcim's stake in ACC and Ambuja Cements. The subsequent increase in capacity to over 100 MTPA by April 2025 further solidifies its position in the industry.

Karan Adani, Chairman of ACC Cement, highlighted the cement industry's crucial role in India's infrastructure development and predicted significant benefits from the estimated USD 2.2 trillion investment planned until 2030.

The cement sector was anticipated to undergo considerable expansion, and ACC's strategic priorities were designed to effectively capitalize on this potential.

The core sector growth in July 2025, which includes cement and steel, was reported at 2.03%. While this was lower than the revised June growth, cement companies were expected to benefit from a seasonally strong period before the monsoon season.

The Union Budget 2025–26, with an allocation of ₹11.21 trillion for the infrastructure sector, was anticipated to provide a further boost to the demand for cement.

ACC was ranked as 'India's Most Trusted Cement Brand 2025' for the third consecutive year by TRA Research in its Brand Trust Report 2025.

ACC was also recognized with the 'GEEF Global Emerging Environmental Excellence Company of the Year 2025' award in the Cement Industry category.

The company is shifting to direct transaction processing for its merchants, moving away from intermediary payment aggregators like Juspay,according to Business Standard.

Paytm's focus continues to be on core payment businesses and distributions of financial services.

It is expanding its merchant base and is expected to see a normalized run-rate for merchant subscriber additions by Q3 FY2025.

The company is investing in technology and infrastructure to lead the merchant payment market, including introducing new devices and aggregating MDR-bearing payment instruments.

Paytm is also diversifying its lending products and partners, expanding into secured lending options.

The fintech giant is actively distributing insurance and wealth products, leveraging merchant insights and exploring new offerings like tailored shop insurance and combined health insurance with healthcare and OPD benefits.

In line with its AI-first approach, Paytm is building services to help merchants grow and retain customers, with potential for international expansion.

Paytm latest news and updates as of May 1, 2025:

In Q1 FY2025, Paytm reported ₹1,502 crore in operating revenue and a contribution profit of ₹755 crore, resulting in a 50% margin. The net payment margin was ₹383 crore, while Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) reached ₹4.3 lakh crore. Merchant Payment Operating Metrics have returned to January 2024 levels. The company's revenue from Financial Services was ₹280 crore and from Marketing Services was ₹321 crore. Paytm is prioritizing cost optimization, achieving a 9% quarter-over-quarter reduction in employee costs and maintaining a strong cash balance of ₹8,108 crore.

Paytm's shares have experienced a notable surge in 2025, driven by positive developments such as the RBI's in-principle approval for its Payment Aggregator (PA) license and the company's recent profit turnaround. The stock has seen a 17% increase year-to-date in 2025 and a 128% rise over the past year.

The RBI granted in-principle approval to Paytm Payments Services Ltd to operate as an online payment aggregator, lifting a previous ban on merchant onboarding. This approval is contingent on the company complying with RBI guidelines and completing a system and cybersecurity audit. It's important to note that certain transactions cannot be processed through escrow accounts designated for PA operations. Paytm is also awaiting permission to onboard new UPI consumers, which is expected to boost its user base.

Despite these positive developments, the RBI restrictions on Paytm Payments Bank Limited (PPBL) remain in effect. PPBL is prohibited from accepting new deposits, top-ups, or credit transactions after March 15, 2024, although customers can still access their existing funds. Paytm's UPI, wallet, and merchant services continue to operate through partner banks."

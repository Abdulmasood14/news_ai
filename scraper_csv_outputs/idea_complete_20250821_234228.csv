Complete_Text,"Financial Situation:In early May 2025, Vodafone Idea's (Vi) financial health remained precarious due to a massive debt exceeding ₹2 lakh crore, including substantial Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) liabilities.

Government Intervention:Despite the severe debt, the company had not filed for bankruptcy, thanks in part to the Indian government's increased equity stake (nearly 49% after converting dues into shares) and ongoing relief petitions in the Supreme Court.

AGR Relief Plea:Vi had filed a new plea in the Supreme Court seeking further relief regarding its AGR dues, with a hearing scheduled for May 19, 2025.

Analyst Outlook:While analysts maintained a cautious stance on Vi's future, they acknowledged that government support had so far averted an insolvency situation.

Share Price:On May 2, 2025, the share price of Vodafone Idea Ltd. remained relatively stable at ₹7.08, despite earlier dips observed in the preceding days.

ARPU Growth:In the period leading up to May 2025, Vi witnessed a slight increase in average revenue per user (ARPU) due to factors like one additional day in the June quarter and growth in postpaid subscribers.

5G Rollout:The company continued its 5G rollout, with launches planned in various cities as part of its network expansion efforts.

Information specifically mentioning ""IDEA"" or ""Vodafone Idea"" on May 1, 2025, primarily revolves around the company's financial struggles and the ongoing efforts to address them:

Note: It's crucial to understand that Vodafone Idea, also known as Vi, was formerly referred to as Idea Cellular. References to ""Idea"" or ""Vodafone Idea"" in these news snippets relate to the same entity."

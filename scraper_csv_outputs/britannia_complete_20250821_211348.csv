Complete_Text,"Focus on Local Manufacturing:The cheese range is now manufactured locally at Britannia Bel Foods' new facility in Ranjangaon, Maharashtra, according to whatpackaging.co.in. This move aims to combine French cheese-making expertise with recipes tailored to Indian tastes.

Improved Product Quality:The refreshed range offers a creamier taste, smoother texture, and enhanced quality.

Nutritional Enhancement:The new recipe incorporates five key nutrients: protein, calcium, and vitamins A, D, and B12.

Wider Product Availability:The Laughing Cow Cheese is available in a full range of products, including slices, cubes, blocks, spread, diced, triangles, and sachets.

Affordability:The company also announced that the new range comes at a more affordable price.

New Advertising Campaign:A campaign titled ""One More Please,"" conceptualized by Schbang, was launched to highlight the improved taste and texture and the irresistibility of the product.

On May 1, 2025, Britannia Industries, in a joint venture with Bel Group (Britannia Bel Foods), launched a revamped range of its Britannia The Laughing Cow cheese products.

Here's a breakdown of the key updates:

Additionally, a pilot program to enhance the retail experience for visually impaired shoppers was launched on April 5, 2025, leveraging Google Astra's capabilities . The program, in partnership with MORE Retail and Mithra Jyoti (an NGO), uses a smartphone app called ""Britannia A-Eye"" to guide visually impaired shoppers through stores and provide voice-based information about products."

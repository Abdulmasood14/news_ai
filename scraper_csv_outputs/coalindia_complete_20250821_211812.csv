For the full fiscal year FY25, the net profit decreased by 5.5% year-on-year to ₹35,358 crore, while revenue declined by 1% to ₹1,43,369 crore.

The company declared a final dividend of ₹5.15 per share for FY25, bringing the total dividend for the year to ₹26.50 per share. This represents a 10% increase over the previous year's total dividend.

Raw coal production for Q4 FY25 was 237.69 million tonnes (MT), a 1.7% decrease year-on-year.

Coal offtake was 201.38 MT, marginally down from 201.66 MT in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

For the full fiscal year, total coal production was 781.05 MT, a 1% increase over FY22.

Coal offtake rose by 1% to 761.71 MT.

Coal India has established a new subsidiary, 'Coal Gas India', to explore opportunities in the coal-to-chemical segment,according to Groww.

Northern Coalfields Limited (NCL), a subsidiary of Coal India, introduced a ""Singrauli Punarasthapan Charge"" of ₹300 per tonne on coal dispatches from all its mines, effective May 1, 2025. This levy is expected to generate additional revenue of approximately ₹3,877.50 crore and will be imposed in addition to the notified coal prices.

Coal India's share price saw a positive reaction to the Q4 FY25 results and dividend announcement, closing 1.6% higher at ₹384.20 on the NSE.

Investors seemed to be reassured by the company's profitability and consistent dividend payouts, despite the slight dip in revenue and production.

Note: This summary focuses on the information available as of May 1, 2025, specifically related to Coal India's financial performance, operational metrics, and key developments. Additional news and updates may have emerged since then."

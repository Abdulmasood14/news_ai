The closure of the trading window was also related to the forthcoming announcement of the company's audited financial results, potentially including a dividend declaration, which was under consideration by the Board of Directors.

A significant tariff revision by the HP grid took effect on May 1, 2025. The regulated tariff was set at ₹18.1 per mmbtu (GCV), a 47% reduction from the previous rate of ₹34 per mmbtu.

Complete_Text,"Mindspace Business Parks REIT was planning to consider raising ₹1,800 crore through debt fundraising. This news, while not directly about HDFCAMC, could be relevant to investors tracking the broader financial market and real estate investment trends, as Mindspace REIT is a related entity.

HDFC Bank revised its ATM transaction charge rate beyond the free limit to ₹23 + taxes, effective May 1, 2025. Although this is specific to HDFC Bank and not HDFCAMC, it is a noteworthy change in banking fees for customers.

FY25 Net Profit and Dividend:HDFC AMC announced its net profit for the Financial Year ended March 31, 2025, at ₹24,609 million, a 26% increase over the previous year. The dividend per share increased to Rs 90 from Rs 70.

New ESOP/PSU Scheme:HDFC AMC announced a new Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) and Performance Stock Units (PSU) scheme, granting 1 million ESOPs and 0.2 million PSUs, effective June 2025. They estimated an expense of Rs 2.05-2.10 billion for this scheme over fiscal years 2026-2030.

HDFC AMC reported a 24% increase in profit after tax to ₹748 crore for Q1 FY26, alongside a 25% rise in revenue to ₹968 crore (Note: This information was reported on July 17, 2025, but reflects the company's performance in the quarter ending June 2025).

Based on the available information, here's a summary of the latest news and updates for HDFCAMC as of May 1, 2025:

1. Mindspace Business Parks REIT Plans Debt Fundraising (May 1, 2025)

2. HDFC Bank ATM Transaction Charge Revision (Effective May 1, 2025)

3. HDFC AMC Financial Results and ESOP/PSU Scheme (Announced later but relevant to the period)

4. Strong Q1 FY26 Earnings Growth (Reported Later)

On May 1, 2025, the key news related to HDFCAMC was around Mindspace REIT's debt fundraising plans and HDFC Bank's ATM fee revision. Later announcements (after May 1, 2025, but relevant to the period) revealed HDFC AMC's strong FY25 financial performance, increased dividend, and the introduction of a new ESOP/PSU scheme. Additionally, Q1 FY26 results reported later showed continued strong earnings growth."

Complete_Text,"FY25 Results:Shree Cement reported its financial results for the fiscal year 2025, with revenue of US$2.38 billion, a 5.5% year-on-year decline. Net profit for FY25 fell by 50% to US$141 million. The company cited increased operating costs (up 2.9% to US$2.17 billion) as a contributing factor to the lower profit.

Q4 FY25 Cement Sales:Cement sales in Q4 FY25 reached 9.84Mt, a 3.3% increase compared to Q4 FY24 (9.53Mt). Premium products constituted 16% of total sales during this period.

Demand Growth Expectations:Shree Cement's Chairman, HM Bangur, anticipated cement demand growth of 7-8% in both calendar year 2025 and financial year 2024-25 (FY25). This growth was projected to be driven by housing demand and increased infrastructure spending.

Regional Price Variations:Bangur noted that cement prices were expected to vary across regions based on supply-demand dynamics. He pointed out that prices were higher in North India due to strong demand and limited capacity additions, while South India faced overcapacity and weaker pricing. Logistics costs were influencing prices upwards in the West, though profitability was expected to remain stable.

Capacity Expansion:Shree Cement was in the process of expanding its capacity, with four planned projects aiming to increase installed capacity by 20% to 55.9Mt/yr.

Focus on Green Power:The company has been actively investing in renewable energy sources, with over 55% of its power consumption coming from green sources, the highest in the Indian cement industry.

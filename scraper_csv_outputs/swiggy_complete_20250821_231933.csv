Complete_Text,"May 6th:Swiggy licensed several of its digital-first food brands (The Bowl Company, Homely, Soul Rasa, and Istah) to Kouzina Food Tech,according to Entrackr. Kouzina will manage operations, innovation, and growth, with full ownership transferring to them after certain conditions are met. This move potentially indicates Swiggy's exit from the private label business and a strategic shift towards focusing on core delivery and quick commerce.

Instamart GOV growth rose to 101% year-on-year, with the addition of 316 new dark stores and expansion to 124 cities.

The Out-of-Home Consumption segment turned profitable in Q4 FY25.

Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA loss increased to INR 732 Cr due to significant growth investments in Quick-commerce.

The company also achieved its highest quarterly net sales at Rs 2,399.63 crore, but also saw a significant decline in profitability with PBT at Rs -1,088.05 crore and PAT at Rs -927.45 crore.

May 12th:The mandatory six-month lock-in period for non-promoter, pre-IPO investors expired, making approximately 83% of Swiggy's shareholding eligible for trading from May 13th. Analysts predicted potential market volatility and profit-taking pressure due to this unlocking of shares.

May 16th:Instamart partnered with Home Centre for 10-minute deliveries.

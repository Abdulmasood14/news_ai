Statutory Earnings Per Share (EPS) were ₹12.27, exceeding analyst estimates by 2.5%.

Note:IGL's Q3 FY25 profit had fallen to ₹325.42 crore, while income rose to ₹4,234.49 crore.

On April 27, 2025, IGL's board of directors recommended a final dividend of ₹1.5 per equity share (75%), subject to shareholder approval. This followed a board meeting to approve the audited financial results for Q4 and FY25 and to consider a final dividend.

The company had a 1:1 bonus issue, with an ex-date of January 31, 2025. This effectively doubled the number of shares held by shareholders.

A board meeting was scheduled for July 30, 2025, to consider and approve the unaudited financial results for Q1 FY26.

The trading window for IGL securities was closed from July 1, 2025, until 48 hours after the results disclosure on July 30, 2025, to prevent insider trading.

IGL is reportedly planning to establish around 80 to 90 compressed natural gas (CNG) stations by March 2025.

The company also aims to achieve 5% compressed biogas (CBG) blending by 2025, surpassing the 2030 deadline set by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MoPNG).

On May 1, 2025, analysts noted a decline in expectations for IGL despite a rise in share price, according to Simply Wall Street . The company's Q4 FY25 financial results revealed a miss on revenue estimates, though statutory earnings per share surpassed projections. This indicates that while IGL's operational efficiency may be improving, as suggested by its Debtors Turnover Ratio, growth momentum might be facing challenges. The stock was considered fairly valued with a PE ratio of 17.10 as of April 21, 2025."

Complete_Text,"Q4 FY25 Results:Avenue Supermarts (DMart) announced its Q4 FY25 and full-year FY25 financial results on May 3, 2025.

Standalone net profit increased by 2.6% year-on-year (YoY) to ₹619.71 crore.

Revenue from operations grew by 16.7% YoY to ₹14,462.39 crore.

Full-year FY25 standalone net profit grew 8.6% to ₹2,927.18 crore.

EBITDA for FY25 was ₹4,543 crore, up from ₹4,099 crore in FY24.

However, margins remained under pressure due to factors like competitive intensity in the FMCG sector and higher operating costs,according to Angel One.

Store Expansion:DMart added 28 new stores in Q4 FY25, the highest quarterly addition in the last four years, bringing the total store count to 415 as of March 31, 2025. The company added a total of 50 stores in FY25,notes Mint.

Online Strategy:DMart Ready, the company's online arm, focuses on delivering value over speed, targeting 3-to-6-hour deliveries instead of quick commerce's 30-minute model. DMart aims for double-digit sales growth in this segment, though losses for DMart Ready widened in FY25 due to expansion and higher operating expenses.

Share Price Performance:DMart shares were trading flat around ₹4,217 on May 2, 2025, ahead of the Q4 results announcement. The stock had delivered a nearly 18% return year-to-date at that time. Following the Q4 announcement, the share price dipped 3.04% on May 5, 2025.

Analyst Outlook:While analysts generally anticipate continued revenue growth due to store expansions, some express concerns about sustained margin pressures due to competition and operating costs. Several analyst reports were released around this time, offering varied perspectives on the company's performance and future outlook.

Trading Window Closure:The trading window for DMart securities was closed from March 15 until two days after the declaration of the financial results for Q4 and FY25.

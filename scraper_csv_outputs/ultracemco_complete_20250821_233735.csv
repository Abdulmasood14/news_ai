Complete_Text,"As of August 21, 2025, UltraTech Cement Ltd. (ULTRACEMCO) is in focus due to its plan to exceed 200 MTPA capacity by FY26, a year ahead of schedule, driven by significant expansions and acquisitions. According to The Economic Times, the company is also among those expected to benefit from a potential GST cut, which could further boost the cement sector's gains in FY26.

In other news, afaqs! reported on April 24, 2025, that UltraTech Cement demonstrated its commitment to sustainability with the ""MahaKumbh ka MahaSankalp"" campaign at Maha Kumbh 2025 in Prayagraj. The initiative collected and processed over 400 metric tons of plastic waste, using it as an alternative fuel for cement manufacturing at its Dalla Cement Works. This effort also included community engagement and awareness programs.

UltraTech Cement also received recognition at the e4m Prime Time Awards 2025, where it was named 'Advertiser of the Year' and won eight trophies. This follows similar recognitions at the ET Brand Disruption Awards 2025 and the ET MarTech+ Awards 2024.

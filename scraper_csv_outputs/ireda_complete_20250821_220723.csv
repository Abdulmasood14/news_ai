Complete_Text,"Operational and Financial Performance:IREDA reported a 49% year-on-year growth in operating profit and a 30% increase in total income in Q1 FY25-26. Loan sanctions grew by 29%, disbursements by 31%, and the outstanding loan book reached ₹79,941 crore, a 26% expansion.

Profitability and Asset Quality:Despite operational growth, net profit declined by 36% year-on-year to ₹247 crore, mainly due to a significant rise in impairment charges. The gross non-performing assets (NPA) ratio increased to 4.13% from 2.19% YoY, and the net NPA ratio rose to 2.06% from 0.95%.

Business Development:IREDA established a wholly-owned subsidiary in GIFT City, operational since March 2025. Shareholders had previously approved fundraising of up to ₹5,000 crore through a QIP in February 2025.

Legal Actions:The company reported fraudulent activities by certain borrowers and has initiated recovery and legal proceedings.

News and updates for IREDA on May 1, 2025, highlight a mix of operational growth and financial challenges.

In summary, IREDA demonstrated strong operational growth in Q1 FY25-26 but faced reduced profitability and increased NPAs. The company is pursuing expansion through a new subsidiary and potential fundraising, while also addressing fraudulent loan accounts."

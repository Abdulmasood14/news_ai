The company plans to invest ₹10,000 crore in a 62-acre township project there. They aim for a Gross Development Value (GDV) of ₹12,000 crore for the entire township. This move aims to bring integrated living (homes, retail, and green areas) to Ghaziabad under the Prestige banner for the first time.

Upcoming Project Launches (FY26):Prestige plans to double its residential launches in the fiscal year 2026 (FY26), targeting cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Delhi-NCR.

Investment Plans in Maharashtra:Prestige Group signed MOUs to invest ₹12,500 crore in developing a data center, a global competency center (GCC), and a logistics center near Navi Mumbai. This plan also includes building residential and commercial facilities around these projects, creating 8,700 direct jobs.

Prestige Evergreen Launch (EOI stage):Prestige Evergreen, part of Prestige Raintree Park Phase 2 in Bangalore, opened for Expression of Interest (EOI) bookings in May 2025. This allows early buyers to potentially save up to 9% on the final price.

Here's a summary of the latest news and updates related to the Prestige Group as of May 1, 2025:

In summary, as of May 1, 2025, Prestige Group was actively pursuing an IPO for its hospitality venture, expanding into the NCR real estate market with a major project in Ghaziabad, and planning for a significant increase in residential project launches in the upcoming fiscal year, despite facing some setbacks in sales bookings in the previous year due to approval delays."

Key growth areas included the Electro-Mechanical Projects, Commercial Air Conditioning, and Room AC segments, reflecting effective strategy and market response.

A final dividend of Rs 9 per share (450%) for FY25 was announced on May 7, 2025.

The Commercial Refrigeration segment faced challenges due to regulatory changes and supply chain issues in the first half of FY25, although demand improved in the fourth quarter with positive future prospects.

Industry-wide supply chain disruptions and high inventory levels presented challenges.

Blue Star was focusing on R&D and local sourcing to improve efficiency and manage costs.

The Room AC business was expected to continue growing due to seasonal demand and a strong order book, with the company holding nearly 14% market share.

According to Moneycontrol analysis from August 14, 2025, the stock sentiment was bullish.

Blue Star maintained an optimistic outlook for future recovery, considering market changes and potential trade opportunities.

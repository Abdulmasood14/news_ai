Despite strong top-line growth, operating margins declined slightly to 10.3% from 11% in the corresponding quarter last year, possibly due to input cost pressures or pricing shifts.

EBITDA rose 18% YoY to ₹301.30 crore.

The company's shares saw a jump of over 5% in intraday trading following the Q4 results announcement.

However, the shares later pared some of the gains, trading 4.4% higher compared to a slight decline in the Nifty 50.

The company expects its largest manufacturing plant in Sanand, Gujarat, to begin production for Phase-1 in September 2025.

The Sanand plant is expected to contribute significantly to the company's growth, potentially adding ₹5,500-6,000 crore to annual sales and increasing the share of exports in the revenue mix to 15-18% over the next three fiscals.

KEI Industries aims to achieve an 18% growth in the current financial year (FY26).

The company's CMD,Anil Gupta, stated on NDTV Profitthat the Sanand facility will help in serving the international market and reduce logistics and shipping costs.

Information available for KEI Industries on May 1, 2025, primarily revolves around the following:

In summary: As of May 1, 2025, KEI Industries was in the news primarily for its robust Q4 FY25 financial results, including significant profit and revenue growth, and positive outlook regarding its new manufacturing plant and export plans. The stock saw positive movement after the results but experienced some fluctuations during the day."

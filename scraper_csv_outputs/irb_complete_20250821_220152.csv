This growth was attributed to the vacation season across the country and the addition of approximately 4.5 lakh new commercial and passenger vehicles in India during May 2025.

The company expects this positive momentum to continue, supported by the completion of several ongoing projects in the coming months.

IRB Infrastructure Developers Ltd. announced its Q1 FY 2025-26 results on August 15, 2025.

The company's net profit for Q1 FY26 climbed 45% year-on-year to ₹202 crore (₹2,020 million) from ₹140 crore (₹1,400 million) in Q1 FY25.

The revenue from operations for Q1 FY26 was ₹2,164.5 crore (₹21,645 million), up from ₹1,971.6 crore (₹19,716 million) in the same period last year.

The Board declared an interim dividend of ₹0.07 per equity share for FY26.

The IRB Maharashtra Expressway remained the top contributor to toll revenue, generating ₹159.5 crore in May, up from ₹152.6 crore a year ago.

The company expects the Ganga project, scheduled to begin in the second half of the year, to further boost overall toll collection.

The company's shares traded marginally higher on June 10, 2025, closing at ₹53.42 on the NSE.

The stock opened at ₹54.38 and touched an intraday low of ₹53.16.

This profit was driven by a 6% underlying volume growth, contributing to a 7% year-on-year organic sales growth in INR terms.

Debt:The company's total debt stood at ₹4,004 crore as of March 31, 2025, which included lease liabilities of ₹121.9 crore. The debt increase was primarily due to the debt-funded acquisition of Raymond's FMCG business in April 2023 for ₹2,725 crore and higher dividend payouts in FY25.

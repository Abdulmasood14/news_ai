Complete_Text,"As of April 23, 2025, Dalmia Bharat released its Q4 FY25 financial results. The company reported a 37% year-on-year increase in net profit, reaching ₹439 crore. However, revenue from operations saw a 5% decline to ₹4,091 crore. Sales volume for the quarter decreased by 3% year-on-year, primarily due to ending JP tolling volumes, but the company noted improved sales quality from higher trade sales and premium product contributions. A final dividend of ₹5 per share (250%) for FY25 was recommended by the Board of Directors.

Key financial figures from Q4 FY25 include a net profit of ₹439 crore (up 37% YoY), revenue of ₹4,091 crore (down 5% YoY), and EBITDA of ₹793 crore (up 21.3% YoY). Sales volume was 8.6 million tonnes, a 3% decrease from the previous year.

Dalmia Bharat also announced significant capacity expansions, including commissioning 2.4 MnT in Lanka, Assam, and 0.5 MnT in Rohtas, Bihar, bringing the total installed capacity to 49.5 MnT. A strategic investment of approximately ₹3,520 crore is planned for further expansion, including new clinker and grinding units. The company also increased its renewable energy capacity by commissioning a 2.2 MW solar plant and adding 13 MW through Group Captive agreements, totaling 267 MW. Total operational renewable capacity is projected to reach 595 MW by the end of FY26."

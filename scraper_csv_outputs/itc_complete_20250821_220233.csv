Complete_Text,"High Dividend Payout:ITC announced a final dividend of ₹7.85 per share for FY25, bringing the total dividend for the year to ₹14.35 per share (including the interim dividend of ₹6.50 already paid). This represents the highest annual dividend payout in the past five years. The record date for the final dividend is set for May 28, 2025. The payment date for the final dividend is expected to be between July 28 and July 31, subject to shareholder approval at the company's 114th Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for July 25, 2025.

Moderate Profit Growth in Q4 FY25 (excluding one-time gain):While the company reported a consolidated net profit of ₹19,727 crore in Q4 FY25, a substantial portion of this (₹15,179 crore) was attributed to a one-time gain from the ITC Hotels demerger. Excluding this one-time gain, the actual net profit increased by a modest 0.8% year-on-year to ₹4,875 crore.

Demerger of Hotels Business:The demerger of ITC's hotels business (ITC Hotels Ltd) became effective on January 1, 2025,according to India Today. ITC retained a 40% stake in the new entity, with the remaining 60% going to ITC shareholders.

News and updates regarding ITC as of May 1, 2025, focus primarily on the company's financial performance and a significant dividend announcement:

In addition to the above, it's worth noting that the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) introduced a new mandatory ""Mode of Export of Services"" field in the eBRC format for service exports, effective from May 1, 2025. This update could have implications for ITC's service export operations."

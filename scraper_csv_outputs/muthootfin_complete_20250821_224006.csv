Complete_Text,"Financial Performance:Muthoot Finance demonstrated robust financial performance. In the quarter ending June 30, 2025 (Q1 FY26), the company achieved its highest-ever quarterly consolidated loan assets under management (AUM) of ₹1.34 lakh crore and a profit of ₹1,974 crore. This was driven by a strong 37% year-on-year growth in loan AUM and a 65% jump in profit. The company's standalone profit surged by 90% to ₹2,046 crore, fueled by strong gold loan growth and lower provisions.

Expansion and Strategic Initiatives:Muthoot Finance's microfinance arm, Belstar Microfinance, began offering gold loans, leveraging the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) relaxed norms for microfinance institutions (MFIs). The company also focused on digital transformation and enhancing customer experience. Equity infusions of ₹5 billion and ₹2 billion were approved for its subsidiaries, Muthoot Money and Muthoot Homefin, respectively.

RBI's New Gold Loan Guidelines:The RBI released draft guidelines for the gold loan sector in May 2025, aiming to standardize gold purity assessment, collateral valuation, and interest rate disclosures. The guidelines also addressed loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and auction procedures for pledged gold. The finance ministry suggested exempting small-ticket gold loans (below ₹2 lakh) from these guidelines to ensure timely disbursement.

Gold Loan Market Growth:The Indian gold loan market experienced substantial growth. By May 2025, the value of gold loans had crossed ₹2.5 lakh crore, marking a 115% year-on-year increase. This growth was attributed to factors like rising gold prices, increased demand for gold loans, and the RBI's measures to improve formal credit availability against gold.

Changes in Banking and Finance:Several changes in banking and finance regulations came into effect on May 1, 2025. These included revised ATM transaction charges, with banks allowed to charge a maximum of ₹23 per transaction beyond the free limit. Additionally, the ""One State-One RRB"" initiative aimed to consolidate regional rural banks to enhance efficiency. The RBI also mandated the use of its PRAVAAH portal for submitting applications for regulatory authorizations and approvals.

As of May 1, 2025, Muthoot Finance was navigating a dynamic environment shaped by both company-specific developments and broader trends in the Indian financial sector.

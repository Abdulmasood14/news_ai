Complete_Text,"USFDA approval for Latanoprostene Bunod Ophthalmic Solution, 0.024%:This approval makes Gland Pharma the exclusive First-to-File and grants them 180 days of generic drug exclusivity for this product, which generated approximately USD 171 million in US sales for the 12 months ending February 2025.

On May 1, 2025, the key news regarding Gland Pharma revolved around regulatory approvals and the announcement of their Q4 FY25 financial results and dividend recommendation.

Gland Pharma announced their Q4 FY25 financial results and a dividend recommendation. Consolidated Revenue for the quarter was INR 14,249 million. The company achieved an EBITDA margin of 24%, with the base business EBITDA margin increasing to 38% due to higher volume in the US portfolio and the launch of new high-margin products. While Profit After Tax (PAT) saw a 3% decrease year-on-year, it increased by 9% quarter-on-quarter, demonstrating a positive sequential trend. The company also reported progress in turning around Cenexi.

The Board recommended a final dividend of â‚¹18 per equity share for FY25, pending shareholder approval at the upcoming 47th AGM.

In Q4 FY25, Gland Pharma filed 5 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and received 7 approvals. For the entire fiscal year FY25, they filed 24 ANDAs and received 32 approvals, bringing their total to 371 ANDA filings in the US, with 318 approved and 53 pending.

Other notable points from the Q4 results included positive indications regarding the closure of recent USFDA inspections at their facilities in Hyderabad, India, and progress in collaborations with partners like DRL and Henlius, with revenue from the DRL business expected to begin in FY26.

It is worth noting that as of May 1, 2025, reports might not have reflected subsequent market movements or analyst updates, such as a share price increase observed later in August 2025."

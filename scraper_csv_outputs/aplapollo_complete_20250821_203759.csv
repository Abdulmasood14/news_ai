The record date for determining shareholders eligible for this dividend was set asAugust 22, 2025.

The 40th AGM was scheduled forSeptember 15, 2025.

The Indian stock market was closed onMay 1, 2025, for Maharashtra Day.

India's steel demand was projected to grow strongly in 2025, driven by infrastructure investments and overall economic growth.

There were discussions around a potential safeguard duty on steel imports to protect domestic producers.

Global steel prices were expected to remain under pressure due to factors like rising Chinese exports and trade uncertainty.

In its Q4 FY25 results (around May 7, 2025), APL Apollo Tubes Ltd. reported strong sales volume growth and a net cash balance sheet.

The company also highlighted its strategy of a cash-and-carry model, which has been successful for the past five years.

While not specific to May 1, 2025, it's worth noting that geopolitical tensions and trade policies (like potential US steel tariffs) could impact the global steel market and, consequently, companies like APL Apollo.

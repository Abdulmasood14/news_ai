The ministry reportedly sent a notice based on inputs from government agencies. While specific details were not disclosed as the probe was in its early stages, Patanjali had approximately two months to respond. This follows previous regulatory issues, including a tax claim and a Supreme Court restraint on misleading advertisements.

Patanjali Foods Q4 FY25 Earnings Anticipation:An earnings preview from May 14, 2025, projected continued margin recovery for Patanjali Foods in Q4 FY25, driven by strong growth in its Food & FMCG segments despite challenges in edible oils. The company is shifting its focus to a broader Food & FMCG portfolio, with this segment contributing over 30% of revenues in Q4 FY24. New product launches and the success of items like Nutrela Doodh biscuits and nutraceuticals are part of this strategy to reduce reliance on volatile edible oil prices. Net profit for Q4 FY25 was anticipated to increase significantly year-over-year.

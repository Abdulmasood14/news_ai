Complete_Text,"Financial Results (Q4 and FY25):Adani Power released its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ending March 31, 2025. FY25 profit increased by 21.4% year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and reduced costs. Operating capacity grew to 17,550 MW in FY25 from 15,250 MW in FY24 due to strategic acquisitions. While power sale volume rose by 18.9% in the March quarter, EBITDA saw a decline due to increased operational expenses from recent acquisitions and lower merchant tariffs. Net Profit for Q4 FY25 decreased by 5.04% YoY to â‚¹2,599 crore, primarily due to higher depreciation costs and a drop in one-time income.

Operational Performance:The company generated 102.2 Billion Units (BU) of electricity in FY25, a 19.5% increase compared to FY24. Power sale volume also increased by 20.7% YoY to 95.9 BU in FY25. The Plant Load Factor (PLF) improved to 71% in Q4 FY25 from 64.7% in the same quarter of the previous year. The Plant Availability Factor (PAF) for FY25 was 91%. The Adani Power CEO highlighted the strong operational and financial performance, attributing it to the resilience of Adani Portfolio companies and a focus on capital and cost efficiencies.

Strategic Expansion & Future Plans:Adani Power aims to reach a total capacity of 30,670 MW by 2030 and plans to invest INR 120,000 crores over the next six years, largely funded by internal accruals. The company anticipates new tenders from state DISCOMs following the central government's recent allocation of 24GW of coal to states. Expansion projects include a 2x800 MW USCTPP expansion at its existing 1,370 MW plant in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, and a greenfield 2x800 MW USCTPP in Mirzapur, Uttar Pradesh.

Challenges and Outlook:Challenges in the merchant market, including price fluctuations and outstanding payments from foreign markets, require a cautious approach to capacity management and revenue optimization. Adani Power expressed optimism that Bangladesh would clear all outstanding dues related to a power-supply deal. India has extended the mandate for imported coal-based power plants to operate at full capacity until June 30, according to a government circular on May 1, 2025.

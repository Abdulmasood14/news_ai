Complete_Text,"On May 6, 2025, KPIT Technologies announced a revised agreement to acquire Caresoft's Global Engineering Solutions business for \$157 million, down from the originally announced \$191 million.

KPIT Tech announced strong Q4 FY25 results, exceeding their FY25 guidance.

The company reported a 15% YoY increase in revenue and a 48.9% YoY increase in net profit.

This strong performance was supported by a healthy cash position of INR 15.8 billion.

Alongside the results, KPIT announced a strategic collaboration with Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India.

KPIT also declared a final dividend of â‚¹6.00 per equity share.

The acquisition aimed to strengthen KPIT's capabilities in vehicle engineering and design, particularly in the truck and off-highway sectors.

Caresoft's expertise in downstream engineering and benchmarking services was expected to help KPIT accelerate product launches and reduce costs for OEMs.

Caresoft's presence in China was seen as a strategic advantage, providing KPIT with valuable insights into the Chinese market.

The partnership focused on accelerating software-defined vehicle development.

KPIT's management expressed caution regarding pricing and profitability due to macroeconomic challenges, while highlighting a focus on geographical expansion and investments in cybersecurity and automation.

On May 1, 2025, KPIT Technologies faced target price reductions from some analysts, despite reporting strong Q4 FY25 results.

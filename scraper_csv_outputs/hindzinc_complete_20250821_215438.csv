Complete_Text,"Financial Results:Hindustan Zinc declared its best-ever fourth-quarter profit after tax, reaching ₹3,003 crore. This was supported by a 20% YoY increase in Q4 revenue to ₹9,087 crore. The company also reported a 33% YoY rise in FY25 profit after tax, amounting to ₹10,353 crore.

Operational Performance:The company achieved record high annual mined metal production of 1,095 KT and refined metal production of 1,052 KT. Notably, the zinc cost of production for FY25 was the lowest in four years at $1,052/MT.

Dividend:Hindustan Zinc announced a first interim dividend of ₹29 per share for FY25.

Sustainability Initiatives:The company signed a 530 MW renewable energy power delivery agreement with Serentica, increasing its renewable energy portfolio to 70% of its overall power requirement.

Expansion Plans:The company outlined plans to expand mined metal capacity from 1.2 million tonnes to 1.5 million tonnes per annum in the first phase by FY28, along with matching refined metal capacity.

Positive Market Sentiment (April 15-23):The Indian stock market saw a strong rally, with the Sensex hitting a new 2025 high on April 23, 2025. This positive sentiment was driven by factors such as positive global cues, robust IT earnings, and steady FII inflows.

Sector-Specific Performance:During April 2025, the IT and auto sectors showed strong performance, with HCL Technologies leading gains after reporting an 8.1% YoY rise in Q4 profit. However, the banking sector experienced profit booking after recent sharp gains.

Market Correction (April 25):The Sensex and Nifty declined on April 25, 2025, influenced by a sharp decline in Axis Bank's stock and rising geopolitical tensions. Disappointing corporate earnings and profit-booking also contributed to the downturn.

Coal Production Growth:India's coal production rose by 3.63% in April 2025, reaching 81.57 MT. This growth was supported by increased output from captive and other mines.

On April 25, 2025, Hindustan Zinc announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ending March 31, 2025, revealing a 47% YoY jump in Q4 net profit to ₹3,003 crore, driven by operational efficiencies and lower production costs.

Complete_Text,"Effective May 1, 2025, the post of Director (Finance) at Indian Railway Finance Corporation Ltd. (IRFC) became vacant due to the superannuation of the incumbent, Ms. Shelly Verma.

The Ministry of Railways has assigned the additional charge of Director (Finance) to Mr. Randhir Sahay, ED/F(S), Railway Board, effective from May 1, 2025, until further orders.

IRFC plans to raise ₹60,000 Crore through various instruments in FY2025-26.

IRFC announced its Q4 FY2024-25 results on April 28, 2025.

The company reported strong Q4 results and is aiming for ₹30,000 Crore disbursement for FY2025-26.

IRFC is expanding its financing activities beyond the Ministry of Railways, focusing on infrastructure and logistics ecosystem with railway linkages.

This includes projects like financing NTPC's BOBR rakes and term loan sanction to NTPC Renewable Energy Limited.

IRFC also emerged as the lowest bidder (L1) for a ₹3,167 crore loan for PVUNL's Banhardih Coal Block.

The company signed MoUs with REMCL for renewable energy projects and MMRDA for ₹50,000 crore in infrastructure development, with the aim of enhancing transport and reducing urban congestion.

IRFC, along with IRCTC, received the 'Navratna' tag from the government on March 3, 2025.

This status grants IRFC more freedom to fund entities within the railway ecosystem."

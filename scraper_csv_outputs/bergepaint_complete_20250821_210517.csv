Stock Split (November 4, 2014): The face value of shares was split from ₹2 to ₹1.

Intense Competition: The paints sector was characterized by intense competition and the entry of new players, which may have impacted Berger Paints' performance and market strategies.

Early Monsoon Impact: The early onset of the monsoon in some parts of India towards the end of May and June 2025 moderated the growth of paint companies, including Berger Paints.

Focus on Sustainable Growth: Berger Paints emphasized its commitment to sustainable growth, brand building, and expanding its distribution network rather than relying on unsustainable discounts or gimmicks. The company also highlighted its focus on technology-led transformation through AI and digital tools.

Berger Paints India Ltd. exhibited a generally declining trend in its stock price throughout the trading day on August 21, 2025, as reflected in the provided minute-by-minute data.
